This Android project provides a second discord mobile app to allow you to check two accounts on your Android device easily.

This app embeds the Discord website, but makes some adjustments to the page so that it can be used on mobile.

**Notifications and some other features do not work!!** Basic messaging, however, is perfectly usable.

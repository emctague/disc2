This Android project provides a second discord mobile app to allow you to check two accounts on your Android device easily.

This app embeds the Discord website, but makes some adjustments to the page so that it can be used on mobile.

**Notifications and some other features do not work!!** Basic messaging, however, is perfectly usable.

This app is extremely janky, and is basically here to bridge the gap til' Discord eventually, just *maybe*, finally
implements account switching.

Note that there are some tools that claim to allow for account switching of apps like Discord on android. I personally
choose not to use these apps, as they are non-open-source apps from primarily Chinese corporations making claims that
seem to be outside of the limits of non-root Android applications. You can certainly try them if you'd like.

This project is not associated with Discord in any way. It is NOT official.
